# DOM--Practice

**First DOM Demo**
==================
This project is a beginner-friendly demonstration of the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript.
It explains how JavaScript can be used to select, style, and manipulate HTML elements in real time.

**Overview**
============
The demo shows five different ways to select elements from an HTML page:

=> Selecting by ID
=> Selecting by class
=> Selecting by tag name
=> Selecting the first matching element with a CSS selector
=> Selecting all matching elements with a CSS selector

--Each method highlights how JavaScript communicates with HTML and CSS to change text, color, and style dynamically.

 **What You Will Learn**
 ==========================
 
1. How to pick a single element using its unique identifier
2. How to work with multiple elements that share the same class or tag
3. The difference between querySelector (first match) and querySelectorAll (all matches)
4. How to loop through a group of elements and apply styles
5. How the DOM acts as a bridge between HTML and JavaScript

**Demo Output**
================

When you open the file in a browser:
Specific paragraphs change color and font
Headings are restyled with new text and colors
List items are recolored
Some text content is printed in the browser console

**How to Use**
===============

Download or clone the repository, then open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
For additional insight, open the browserâ€™s developer console to view the logged outputs.

**Purpose**
============

This project was created as a small, hands-on example to build confidence in using DOM selection methods.
It serves as a foundation for moving on to advanced concepts like event handling, form interactions, and error handling.
